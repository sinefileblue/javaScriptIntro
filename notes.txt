// A breakdown of the expression \`Number.parseInt(value); step-by-step:`\

Number: This is a built-in object in JavaScript. It's used for numeric operations and conversions.

parseInt: This is a function that is a property of the Number object. It is used to parse a string argument and returns an integer. It extracts an integer from the beginning of the string. If the string does not start with a valid integer, it returns NaN (Not a Number).

(value): This is the argument passed to the parseInt function. It's a placeholder for the string that you want to parse into an integer. You would replace value with the actual string you want to parse.

Putting it all together:

Number.parseInt(value);: This line of code calls the parseInt function, which is a property of the Number object. It takes a string (value) as input, attempts to parse it as an integer, and returns the integer value. If the string cannot be parsed as an integer, it returns NaN.

// In case of NaN; the function \`parseInt(value)`\ may be called

 is a built-in function in JavaScript used for parsing a string argument and converting it into an integer (a whole number). Here's the breakdown:

Number: Number is a built-in object in JavaScript. It provides methods for working with numbers.

parseInt: parseInt() is a method of the Number object. It is used to parse a string and extract an integer from it.

Usage: Number.parseInt() is typically used when you have a string that represents an integer (e.g., "42")
and you want to convert it into an actual integer value (42).
It takes a string as input and returns an integer parsed from that string.

    Example: 
        let str = "42";
        let num = Number.parseInt(str);
        console.log(num); // Output: 42

Radix Parameter (Optional): parseInt() also accepts an optional second parameter
called the radix, which specifies the base of the numeral system to be used. 
It can be an integer between 2 and 36. If omitted, parseInt() assumes base 10 unless
the string begins with "0x" (indicating base 16) or "0" (indicating base 8).

    Example:
        let binaryStr = "1010";
        let decimalNum = Number.parseInt(binaryStr, 2);
        console.log(decimalNum); // Output: 10

Return Value: If the first character of the string cannot be converted to a number, 
parseInt() returns NaN (Not a Number). Otherwise, it returns the integer parsed from the string.

Number.parseInt() is commonly used in JavaScript when dealing with
user input, parsing data from APIs, or converting strings to integers for mathematical operations.

Triple equals operator, also written as \`===`\, is a comparison used in programming
languages to compare equality of 2 values.
